# Introduction to Blender 3.0
by Gianpiero Moioli.

This repository contains the demo files of the book published by Apress [Introduction to Blender 3.0](https://).
The volume aims to provide the technical basis to use Blender creatively.
This software puts at our disposal a set of disparate instruments of expression available for many uses from art to architecture, from painting to design, etc.
In this book, I have tried to demonstrate the wide range of realization and creative possibilities in Blender, limited only by the artist's imagination.

## Introduction to Blender 3.0.
### Learn Organic and Architectural Modeling, Lighting, Materials, Painting, Rendering, and Compositing with Blender.

The folders contain the reference images and 3D demonstration files of the examples included in the book.
Each folder embeds the files for deepening and understanding the themes developed in the respective chapter.
#### Looking at the folder's contents

The first chapter contains a theoretical introduction to Blender 3.0 and its interface, for which there are no exercises.
##### Second chapter
The second chapter, dedicated to 3D modeling, explores two ways of creating virtual objects: building a thing from a primitive and another from a single vertex.
In the first case, we learned how to create a simple teapot editing a Sphere primitive. In the second, we created a glass by extruding a single vertex, building a profile, and applying modifiers, as we can see in the figure.

So, in the first folder, we find the files of the modeled objects and the reference images used to create them.
##### Third chapter
