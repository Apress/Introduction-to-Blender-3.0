# Introduction to Blender 3.0
by Gianpiero Moioli.

This repository contains the demo files of the book published by Apress [Introduction to Blender 3.0](https://).
The volume aims to provide the technical basis to use Blender creatively.
This software puts at our disposal a set of disparate instruments of expression available for many uses from art to architecture, from painting to design, etc.
This book tries to demonstrate the wide range of Blender's realization and creative possibilities in different fields, limited only by the artist's imagination.

## Introduction to Blender 3.0.
### Learn Organic and Architectural Modeling, Lighting, Materials, Painting, Rendering, and Compositing with Blender.

The folders contain the reference images and 3D demonstration files of the examples included in the book.
Each folder embeds the files for deepening and understanding the themes developed in the respective chapter.
#### Looking at the folder's contents
##### Thirst chapter
The first book's chapter contains a theoretical introduction to Blender 3.0 and its interface, for which there are no examples. 
##### Second chapter
The second chapter, dedicated to 3D modeling, explores two ways of creating virtual things: building an object from a primitive and another from a single vertex.
In the first case, we learn how to create a simple teapot editing a Sphere. In the second, we create a glass by extruding a single vertex, making a profile, then applying two modifiers to give the volume, as we can see in the figure.

So, in the first folder, we find the files of the modeled objects and the reference images used to create them.
In the same chapter, we deal with Modeling in Sculpt Mode.
The teapot material is created with PBR textures downloaded from the site https://ambientcg.com/.
Instead, the glass reproduces a material of @chippwalters downloadable for free from Gumroad.
##### Third chapter
In the third chapter, we deepen architectural construction and environmental modeling.
We build architectural and urban spaces using both manual and automatic techniques. Then, finally, we make objects, furniture, and people to populate the environment. 
This chapter's files also include the results of using an add-on to import maps, terrain, and buildings into Blender: BlenderGIS, shown in the figure.

You can find the add-on here: https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS.  
This folder also contains the results obtained with other Blender plug-ins for parametric and procedural modeling, such as Maze, Sorcar, and Sverchok.
The same directory also includes the files LivingRoom, Humans, and RedChair, which contain a model of an architectural interior, shown in the figure, furnished and populated by humans that we learn to model in this chapter.

##### Fourth chapter
The fourth chapter shows how to make materials and textures, assign them to objects, and adequately illuminate the scene to create the environment.
We present some theoretical principles of nodal materials, PBR materials, texture creation, and lighting systems. Then, we apply the theoretical principles in the exercises and create different materials: traditional, PBR, and procedural, like the one shown in the figure.

We find Blender files with different nodal materials and a procedural metal in the folder. In addition, the book lists several sites from which to download free professional-grade PBR textures.  
##### Fifth chapter
The fifth chapter teaches us to paint with Blender's internal digital painting tools and devices and other graphic editing software.
In Blender, we can paint, for various purposes, in Texture Paint, Vertex Paint, and Weight Paint modalities.
We can create textures for our PBR materials by painting them within Blender, or we can make them with external software, then apply them to our materials as shown in the figure's chair.

We can use the graphics tablet.
The files you can find in the relative folder propose some painting methods in Blender for creating images and textures. Also, in the fifth chapter, we discuss some ways for applying the created textures to materials.
##### Sixth chapter
The sixth chapter teaches us to render our scene and transform it into an image or video. Blender 3.0 supports various professional file formats for pictures and videos.
There are four different internal renderers: Eevee, Cycles, Workbench, and Freestyle.
After, we can also do post-production with Blender Compositing and Video Editing tools. We can use Blender as a compositor, or video sequence editor, with a wide range of effects available, as shown in the figure.

The examples of the files in the sixth chapter's folder help us understand and deepen the use of Blender compositor and video editor. For instance, in this folder, we can find image editing examples with Blender compositor and a short video that uses effects, transitions, and other Blender tools for post-production.
